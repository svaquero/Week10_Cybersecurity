            <h3>Email Scams</h3>
            <p>Attackers have dozens of common strategies. If you have a free email solution such as Gmail and use your email address on contact forms across the internet, you probably have scam emails in your spam inbox.</p>
            <p>Attackers might cast a wide net by sending email scams by the thousands. In this model, the more emails sent, the better chance of tricking numerous targeted users.</p>
            <p>Other attackers might take a more targeted approach, carefully choosing a recipient with the right access to data, systems or resources. The attacker researches the victim online and tailors the emails to be as personal and convincing as possible. In some cases, the attacker has already compromised a legitimate email account and has access to previous email conversations, calendars and contactsâ€”ammunition for highly convincing impersonations.</p>
